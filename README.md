# Forecasting-of-AUD-CNY-Exchange-Rates-Insights-for-Optimized-Procurement
This report explores how forecast analysis can offer businesses strategic opportunities in response to specific commercial challenges. The focus is on an e-commerce fashion brand based in Australia. 


Project Overview
This project analyses the exchange rate between the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the Chinese Yuan (CNY) to determine the best period in the coming year for purchasing products from China. The goal is to help businesses optimize procurement decisions based on favorable currency exchange trends.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset to minimize impact on forecasting accuracy.
Stationarity Analysis: Applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirming that the time series is stationary.
Forecasting Model: Used Facebook's Prophet model due to its effectiveness in handling seasonal trends.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Key Findings
The analysis suggests that the optimal period to purchase products from China is between July and September, when the exchange rate is most favorable.
